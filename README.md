# ST4288 Project
Statistical Modelling and Interaction Mapping in an Online Support Community

## Description
This project utilizes Discord chat datasets from SAFEHOUSE, an initiative by Limitless, a non-profit organization focused on mental health. The aim is to uncover meaningful patterns and structures within the datasets through exploratory data analysis, natural language processing and statistical modeling. The overarching goal is to answer research questions: 

1. To better understand the existing SAFEHOUSE user base and evaluate how the platform has impacted them 
2. To uncover meaningful patterns within the Discord chat channels so that processes can be improved to better provide mental health support for youths.
